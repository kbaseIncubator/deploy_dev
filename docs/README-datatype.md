# Adding a new datatype to the Workspace

KBase data objects are strongly typed, meaning that the datatype has a structure with required and optional fields.  This structure is enforced during creation.
You can add types to the system.  However, please consult the [Project Guides](https://github.com/kbase/project_guides) before trying to add new types.
